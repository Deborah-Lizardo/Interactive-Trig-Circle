# Interactive Trigonometric Circle 

Learn and explore trigonometry visually! With this tool, you’ll be able to easily grasp how angles relate to trigonometric functions.


##  Project Objective 📐

This project was developed as part of a challenge in the course **Modelagem de Fenômenos Físicos** (Modeling of Physical Phenomena). The goal is to provide an **interactive trigonometric circle** that helps users visualize key trigonometric functions (like **sine**, **cosine**, and **tangent** ) with a dynamic angle control.

The main objective is to make the concept of the **unit circle** more intuitive, especially the relationships between the angle (θ) and the corresponding values for sine, cosine, and tangent. 

From **0° to 180°** (or from **0 to π** radians), users can adjust the angle and instantly see how the **trigonometric projections** behave. Whether you're studying 📚 or teaching ✏️ trigonometry, this tool offers a fun and interactive way to explore these concepts! 

## Features

- **Visualize the unit circle** with angle θ and its projections (sine, cosine, and tangent).
- **Interactive slider** to adjust angle θ from 0° to 180° (0 to π radians).
- **Dynamic projections**: View sine, cosine, and tangent values changing as you move the slider.
- **Educational tool**: Ideal for understanding how trigonometric functions behave with respect to the angle.

## 📏 How to Run the Project

This project is designed to work in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebooks** environments, which support interactive widgets. You can’t use the interactive slider in traditional IDEs like **VS Code** without additional setup.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

- `numpy` (for mathematical calculations) ➗
- `matplotlib` (for plotting 📊)
- `ipywidgets` (for the interactive slider 🎛️)

You can install these libraries using the following pip command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib ipywidgets
